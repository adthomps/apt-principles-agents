# Visa Acceptance Review

## Purpose

Produce a reviewable visa acceptance review outcome that is grounded in repository evidence and explicit about uncertainty.

## When to Use

Use for planning, design, implementation review, migration, troubleshooting, or documentation where the task must model the complete transaction lifecycle and explicitly address money movement, tokenization, risk, reconciliation, funding, support, and provider differences.

## Inputs

- Goal, audience, scope, constraints, and success criteria.
- Relevant source files, contracts, examples, logs, and decisions.
- Known risks, assumptions, dependencies, and approval boundaries.

## Process

1. Restate the intended outcome and affected audiences.
2. Inventory exact current behavior and source-backed constraints.
3. Apply the relevant APT principles and identify missing evidence.
4. Compare viable options, including compatibility and operational effects.
5. Produce the required artifacts: lifecycle states, amount and currency rules, idempotency, provider mapping, token boundaries, settlement/funding flow, reconciliation, disputes, and support identifiers.
6. Review invented provider behavior, double processing, confused authorization and settlement, sensitive-data exposure, incomplete reversals, and weak reconciliation; separate blockers, recommendations, and open questions.

## Outputs

A concise recommendation, evidence map, required changes, risks, validation plan, support/documentation impact, and approval status.

## Quality Bar

The output is practical, source-backed, audience-aware, testable, reversible where possible, and does not state assumptions as facts.

## Domain Checklist

- Treat **Visa Acceptance Review** as an explicit decision with defined scope, evidence, owner, and validation.
- Required evidence: transaction states, money movement, tokens, provider mapping, risk, funding, reconciliation.
- State what is verified, what is assumed, and what requires specialist or human approval.

## Required Reading

Read the canonical Payments principle hub, the closest enforceable standard, the applicable checklist, and exact target-repository evidence.
