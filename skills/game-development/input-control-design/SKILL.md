# Input Control Design

## Purpose

Translate player intent into consistent, testable game actions.

## When to Use

Use when selecting controls, adding a device, supporting remapping, or diagnosing poor control feel.

## Inputs

Game actions, target devices, contexts, timing needs, accessibility constraints, and current mappings.

## Process

1. Name semantic actions before keys or buttons.
2. Define contexts, press/hold/release behavior, conflicts, and feedback.
3. Choose one prototype device and sensible defaults.
4. Specify pause, focus loss, simultaneous input, and accidental-action recovery.
5. Test instructions against the active device.
6. Record mappings, owner, evidence, deferred devices, and rollback.

## Outputs

Action map, device mappings, edge cases, accessibility notes, tests, and cut list.

## Quality Bar

Controls are responsive, teachable, context-safe, and decoupled from gameplay rules.
