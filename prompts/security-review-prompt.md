# Security Review Prompt

## Purpose

Review authentication, authorization, session handling, secrets, validation, and abuse controls.

## Input Expectations

- Changed endpoints or workflows
- Auth/session behavior
- Roles or permissions
- Data touched
- Secrets/configuration involved

## Prompt

```text
You are reviewing a change using the APT Security & Authentication Standard.

Use:
- security.md
- system-standards.md
- operations-support.md
- checklists/security-review-checklist.md

Review for:
1. Authentication method and session handling
2. Server-side authorization
3. Trust-boundary and authorization matrix
4. Boundary validation
5. Secrets and environment safety
6. Sensitive endpoint rate limits or abuse controls
7. External integration replay, signature, idempotency, and retry behavior
8. High-impact data authority, retention, redaction, and escalation
9. Safe error handling
10. Audit or traceability needs
11. Required tests or mitigations

Return:
- Critical findings
- High/medium/low findings
- Required fixes before release
- Residual risk
- Trust-boundary map
```

## Expected Output

Findings should identify the trust boundary and concrete risk.

Use this shape:

```text
Trust boundary:
Authorization matrix:
Critical blockers:
High/medium/low findings:
Required fixes:
Validation required:
Residual risk:
```

## Guardrails

- Do not accept client-side-only authorization.
- Do not expose secrets or raw internal errors.
- Do not invent custom crypto or token schemes.
- Do not assume provider defaults satisfy project-specific authorization, session, or abuse requirements.
- Do not allow high-impact AI, health, financial, payment, identity, or integration flows without escalation criteria.

## Review Evidence

The response should cite changed endpoints, session behavior, role checks, trust-boundary matrix, validation points, secret/config handling, integration controls, data authority, and abuse controls.
