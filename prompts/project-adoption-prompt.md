# APT Project Adoption Prompt

## Purpose

Use this prompt to apply `apt-principles-agents` to a real project without casually forking doctrine. The output should identify adoption mode, local docs, project-specific decisions, validation evidence, and public showcase readiness.

## Input Expectations

Provide the project name, repository structure, intended audience, current maturity, principle areas used, validation commands, and whether the project should appear on the Applied Practical Thinking public site.

## Prompt

```text
Review this project for APT adoption readiness.

Canonical source:
- apt-principles-agents/

Project context:
- Project name:
- Purpose:
- Audience:
- Current maturity:
- Repository/docs structure:
- APT principle areas used:
- Validation commands:
- Public showcase intent:
- Installed agent standards or desired profiles:

Return:
1. Recommended adoption mode: copy, sync, apply, or showcase.
2. Required local docs and where they should live.
3. Project-specific decisions or exceptions that need records.
4. Agent standards recommendation: use apt-principles-agents profiles, local project context, or no managed install.
5. Missing checklists, prompts, examples, or references.
6. Project profile draft for public or internal reuse.
7. Validation and evidence required before promotion.
```

## Expected Output

- Adoption mode recommendation.
- Local APT docs structure.
- Principle coverage table.
- Project profile draft.
- Validation gaps and next actions.
- Public showcase readiness notes.

## Guardrails

- Do not rewrite canonical APT doctrine inside the project.
- Do not merge apt-principles-agents installer behavior into apt-principles-agents or target project doctrine.
- Do not treat installed `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or `.github/` files as canonical doctrine when they should point back to apt-principles-agents.
- Do not claim production maturity without evidence.
- Do not invent missing architecture, security, or AI usage.
- Keep local exceptions separate from reusable APT improvements.
