# Architecture Review Prompt

## Purpose

Review structure, boundaries, deployment fit, and ownership before implementation or release.

## Input Expectations

- Feature or system summary
- Affected apps/packages/services
- API/data contracts
- Deployment target
- Known constraints

## Prompt

```text
You are reviewing architecture using APT Architecture Standards.

Use:
- architecture.md
- system-standards.md
- security.md
- ai-agent-framework.md when AI is involved
- checklists/architecture-review-checklist.md

Review for:
1. Clear responsibility placement
2. Frontend/backend/package boundary safety
3. API and data contract clarity
4. Shared package leakage
5. Ownership and command matrix for deployable surfaces and shared packages
6. Deployment and preview fit
7. Failure, rollback, and observability readiness
8. AI prompt/handler ownership if applicable

Return:
- Findings by severity
- Boundary violations
- Required artifacts
- Smallest architecture-safe correction
- Decision records needed for high-risk changes
```

## Expected Output

Findings should name the violated boundary and the intended owner.

Use this shape:

```text
System/change:
Boundary map:
Findings by severity:
Required artifacts:
Ownership/command matrix:
Smallest safe correction:
Validation/release impact:
```

## Guardrails

- Do not suggest new architecture when an existing pattern solves the problem.
- Do not move business logic into UI or route glue.
- Do not bypass security or deployment standards.
- Do not accept undocumented manual deployment or ownership for a changed boundary.

## Review Evidence

The response should cite affected apps/packages, contracts, deploy targets, ownership, command matrix, rollback path, and reference maps.
