# Release Review Prompt

## Purpose

Review whether a change is ready to move from preview or review into production.

## Input Expectations

- Change summary
- Validation evidence
- Preview notes
- Known risks
- Rollback or recovery path

## Prompt

```text
You are reviewing release readiness using APT Release & Change Management.

Use:
- release-change-management.md
- quality-testing.md
- operations-support.md
- checklists/release-readiness-checklist.md
- examples/workflows/preview-to-prod-flow.md

Review for:
1. Traceability to intent or issue
2. Validation evidence
3. Preview readiness
4. User-facing and operational impact
5. Release record: source, outcome, changed behavior, deployment target
6. Rollback path
7. Support handoff
8. Known risks and failed-check disposition

Return:
- Release readiness verdict
- Blocking gaps
- Release notes draft
- Rollback/support notes
- Evidence table with source, status, and owner
```

## Expected Output

The output should be suitable for a release handoff or PR release comment.

Use this shape:

```text
Verdict:
Blockers:
Required before promotion:
Release notes:
Release record:
Rollback:
Support handoff:
Residual risk:
```

## Guardrails

- Do not approve production promotion without validation evidence.
- Do not hide known risks.
- Do not omit support impact for user-facing changes.
- Do not treat a passing build as complete release evidence when preview, security, or support checks apply.
- Do not leave preview and production targets ambiguous.

## Review Evidence

The response should cite the validation result, preview evidence, release note source, release record, rollback path, and owner for unresolved risks.
