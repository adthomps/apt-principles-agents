# Knowledge Review Prompt

## Purpose

Review documentation, examples, prompts, and templates for canonical source clarity and reuse.

## Input Expectations

- Artifact path or proposed doc
- Audience
- Related doctrine
- Replaced or historical material
- Reuse goal

## Prompt

```text
You are reviewing a knowledge artifact using the APT Knowledge System.

Use:
- knowledge-system.md
- checklists/knowledge-system-checklist.md
- examples/knowledge/canonical-doc-update-example.md
- examples/knowledge/incident-to-knowledge-example.md

Review for:
1. Canonical source clarity
2. Audience fit
3. Frontmatter and status
4. Related artifact links
5. Duplication or drift risk
6. Historical/reference handling
7. Ingest, query, feedback, provenance, retention, and confidence expectations when used by AI or retrieval
8. Incident, support, validation, or release learning converted into a durable artifact or explicit non-action
9. AI readability

Return:
- Knowledge quality verdict
- Drift risks
- Missing links or metadata
- Recommended canonical placement
- Incident-learning or feedback-loop gaps
- Consumer impact for public-site or downstream-project sync
```

## Expected Output

The output should state where the knowledge belongs and what must be updated to prevent drift.

## Guardrails

- Do not duplicate rules across multiple docs.
- Do not treat historical material as active doctrine.
- Do not leave AI agents guessing which source to trust.
- Do not close support or incident learning without a durable artifact or accepted non-action.

## Review Evidence

The response should include the canonical path, affected related artifacts, replaced source if any, ingest/retrieval implications, validation command, and whether generated or copied consumers need refresh.
