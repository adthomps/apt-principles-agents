# APT Product Team

An internal APT product-thinking cockpit, currently implemented as a Claude Code-oriented Working Backwards workflow.

Instead of jumping straight to requirements, Working Backwards forces you to start from the customer: write the Press Release first, stress-test it with hard questions, then — and only then — write the engineering spec. This extension makes that process rigorous, structured, and impossible to shortcut.

This folder is the internal APT product-thinking lab, maintained as a subsystem of `apt-principles-agents`. Keep its Working Backwards workflows, experiments, planning sessions, and source examples here. Reusable doctrine, provider-neutral templates, rubrics, and task contracts belong in the canonical repository; polished external/demo behavior belongs in `apt-dream-to-reality`.

Intake-like reports can be analyzed here as planning evidence, but this subsystem is not the durable intake queue. Operational intake remains in `../../apt-intake`; reusable intake/routing doctrine belongs in the parent repository; productized intake-to-planning behavior belongs in `../../apt-dream-to-reality`. See [Intake Application Direction](./INTAKE_APPLICATION_DIRECTION.md).

## APT Workspace Status

This internal planning subsystem is tracked by the parent `apt-principles-agents` Git repository. Use the parent repository for version control; do not initialize a nested repository or register this folder as a separate workspace consumer. The Product Team remains an internal planning cockpit, not a separate product or source of canonical doctrine.

Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md), [project context](./docs/project-context.md), [operating model](./docs/operating-model.md), and [session retention policy](./docs/session-retention-policy.md) before changing local rules, templates, sessions, or promotion paths.

Current ownership decision: retain the Product Team workflow inside `apt-principles-agents/product-team/`, with its own planning boundary and shared repository history. See [Next-Level Decision](./docs/next-level-decision.md).

Local session outputs are planning evidence. They are not canonical doctrine, approved product behavior, live intake records, or public proof until promoted to the owning repository. Use `working-backwards/active/`, `working-backwards/promotion-candidates/`, and `working-backwards/archive/` to keep the cockpit clean.

---

## What it does

Runs a stage-gated pipeline with four stages:

```
Stage 1: Press Release     → Who is the customer? What do they get?
Stage 2: External FAQ      → What would a skeptical customer ask?
Stage 2: Internal FAQ      → What would engineering and leadership ask?
Stage 3: Requirements      → Engineer-ready spec derived from the above
```

Each stage is reviewed by a **Critic agent** before the next stage unlocks. You cannot write requirements until your Press Release and FAQ have passed. That's the point.

The original extension design commits outputs to GitHub after each stage passes. In this APT subsystem, outputs remain planning evidence in the parent repository unless a promotion path is explicitly chosen.

---

## Prerequisites

For the current local cockpit:

1. **Claude Code** — [Install Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)
2. This workspace folder.

For the original Git-backed extension behavior:

1. **`gh` CLI** — installed and authenticated:
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   gh auth login
   ```
2. **Git** — configured with push access to the chosen repository.

---

## Setup

### 1. Use the local cockpit

Open Claude Code in this folder:

```bash
claude
```

### 2. Clone the original extension only if needed

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brianmc/AI-Product-Team.git
cd AI-Product-Team
```

### 3. Open Claude Code in the chosen directory

```bash
claude
```

The skills and agents load automatically from `.claude/` when Claude Code opens in this directory.

### 3. Verify setup

Run this in Claude Code to confirm the skills are available:

```
/working-backwards
```

If prompted for a feature idea, setup is working. If you see an authentication error, run `gh auth login` and try again.

### 4. Run local cockpit validation

```powershell
.\scripts\validate-local.ps1
```

Use `-Strict` when active sessions should be empty.

---

## Usage

### Start a new session

```
/working-backwards [your feature idea]
```

**Examples:**
```
/working-backwards "bulk export tool for enterprise customers"
/working-backwards "a way for admins to see real-time audit logs"
/working-backwards "self-serve billing for SMB customers"
```

You'll be walked through the full pipeline. The Press Release Agent will ask you about your customer, their problem, and what the product does for them — before writing a single word.

### Resume a session

```
/working-backwards resume [session-id]
```

**Example:**
```
/working-backwards resume wb-20260308-143022
```

The session picks up exactly where you left off. All prior stage outputs are loaded from GitHub automatically.

### Check session status

```
/wb-status [session-id]
```

If you omit the session ID and only one session exists, it displays that one automatically. With multiple sessions, it lists them and asks which to show.

**Example output:**
```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  WORKING BACKWARDS SESSION
  ID:      wb-20260308-143022
  Feature: bulk export tool for enterprise customers

  Committed artifacts:
    ✓ press-release.md
    ✗ faq-external.md   (pending)
    ✗ faq-internal.md   (pending)
    ✗ requirements.md   (pending)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Run `/working-backwards resume wb-20260308-143022` to continue.
```

## The pipeline in detail

### Stage 1: Press Release

The Press Release is written as if the product has already shipped. This forces you to describe it from the customer's perspective before a single requirement is written.

**The Press Release Agent will ask:**
- Who specifically is the customer? (Not "users" — a named role, persona, or segment)
- What is their problem today? What are they doing instead?
- What does the product do for them?

**Required sections in the output:**
| Section | What it contains |
|---|---|
| Headline | One sentence: product name + specific customer benefit |
| Subheading | Who is the customer and what can they now do? |
| Problem paragraph | Specific, evidenced pain — not generic frustration |
| Solution paragraph | What the product does in plain language |
| Spokesperson quote | Why this matters — substantive, not marketing copy |
| Getting started | How a customer begins using it |
| Customer quote | Specific and believable — marked `[placeholder]` if not yet validated |

**Critic rubric (5 dimensions):**
- Customer definition — specific, not vague
- Problem evidence — concrete, not generic
- Customer benefit — clear and specific
- Spokesperson quote — substantive, not boilerplate
- Customer quote — specific and honest about placeholders

The stage passes when all 5 dimensions pass. Maximum 3 revision cycles before the pipeline pauses and asks you to gather more customer evidence.

---

### Stage 2: External FAQ

The hardest questions a skeptical target customer would ask. 5–8 questions minimum, prioritised by which ones are most likely to reveal product weaknesses. Every question must be answered or explicitly marked `[OPEN — owner: X]`.

---

### Stage 2: Internal FAQ

The hardest questions from engineering, legal, finance, and leadership. Covers feasibility, compliance, business model, and build plan. Build-blocking issues are flagged as `[BLOCKER]`.

---

### Stage 3: Requirements

Translated directly from the validated Press Release and FAQ. Every requirement traces back to the PR or FAQ — nothing invented independently. Open items from the FAQ surface as explicit `[OPEN]` gaps. Engineer-ready, with acceptance criteria in given/when/then format.

---

## Output structure

Every session produces a directory in this folder:

```
working-backwards/
  {session-id}/
    press-release.md      ← committed when Stage 1 passes the Critic
    faq-external.md       ← committed when Stage 2 External passes
    faq-internal.md       ← committed when Stage 2 Internal passes
    requirements.md       ← committed when Stage 3 passes
    session.json          ← updated after every agent interaction
```

In the original Git-backed design, each stage output is committed to GitHub the moment the Critic approves it. In this local workspace, each stage output is saved under `working-backwards/active/`, then archived or moved to promotion candidates after review.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Invoked by |
|---|---|---|
| `press-release-writer` | Drafts and revises Press Releases | Orchestrator (Stage 1) |
| `faq-writer` | Generates and answers hard questions (External + Internal modes) | Orchestrator (Stage 2) |
| `requirements-writer` | Translates validated PR + FAQ into engineering specs | Orchestrator (Stage 3) |
| `critic` | Reviews all stage outputs against versioned rubrics | Orchestrator (after each worker) |

Agents live in `.claude/agents/`. They are invoked by the Orchestrator — you never call them directly.

---

## Critic rubrics

Rubrics live in `.claude/rubrics/` as versioned JSON files. They define the pass/fail criteria the Critic uses for each stage.

| File | Stage | Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| `stage-1-press-release.json` | Press Release | Customer definition, problem evidence, customer benefit, spokesperson quote, customer quote |
| `stage-2-external-faq.json` | External FAQ | Question quality, answer completeness, evasion, coverage of critical concerns |
| `stage-2-internal-faq.json` | Internal FAQ | Coverage of engineering/legal/business, open items, blocker flagging |
| `stage-3-requirements.json` | Requirements | Requirement traceability, testable ACs, edge cases, NFRs, open item propagation |

**To update a rubric:** edit the JSON file and increment the `version` field. No agent redeployment needed. The version used in each Critic review is recorded in `session.json`.

---

## Skills

Skills are loaded automatically when Claude Code opens in this directory. You do not need to load them manually.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `working-backwards` | Main Orchestrator — `/working-backwards [idea]` |
| `wb-status` | Session status — `/wb-status [session-id]` |
| `github-operations` | Shared gh CLI + git instructions for all agents |
| `working-backwards-methodology` | Shared Working Backwards reference knowledge |

---

## Handling edge cases

**"I already have a draft Press Release"**
Start a session normally and paste your draft when the Press Release Agent asks for context. It will validate against the rubric rather than starting from scratch.

**"The Critic keeps failing my Press Release"**
After 3 revision cycles without a PASS, the pipeline pauses and saves your best draft. The Critic's feedback will tell you specifically what's missing. In most cases, this means you need more customer evidence — talk to 2–3 customers and come back with real data and quotes. Resume with `/working-backwards resume [session-id]`.

**"I want to skip the FAQ and go straight to requirements"**
The pipeline won't allow this. Stage 2 is locked until Stage 1 passes; Stage 3 is locked until both Stage 2 stages pass. This is intentional — requirements written without a validated PR and FAQ are requirements for the wrong product.

**"The Critic keeps failing my Requirements document"**
This usually means one of two things: a requirement doesn't trace back to anything in the Press Release or FAQs (cut it, or go ask the underlying question first), or an `[OPEN]`/`[BLOCKER]` item from the FAQ stage quietly disappeared instead of being carried forward or marked resolved. Read the Critic's `traceability` and `open-item-propagation` feedback closely — these two dimensions catch the most common Requirements-stage mistakes.

**"Someone edited my session files directly in GitHub"**
Inspect the parent repository's changes and preserve source evidence before overwriting session files.

**"I need to run this in a different repo"**
The skills are scoped to this `product-team/` subsystem. Session outputs remain planning evidence here; record a separate target repository as a promotion destination rather than moving the cockpit or creating another repository.

## Contributing

The PRD for this project lives at [`prd-pm-ai-team.md`](./prd-pm-ai-team.md). All agent behaviours, Critic rubrics, acceptance criteria, and edge case handling are specified there.

To propose a change: update `prd-pm-ai-team.md` first, then implement. The PRD is the source of truth.
