# Feedback Alert Toast Pattern

## Context

APT workflows need to tell users what happened, what is happening, and what to do next without turning every state into a modal interruption.

## Problem

Feedback often drifts into vague banners, decorative status colors, or transient toasts that disappear before users can recover from an error.

## APT Principles Applied

- Design: complete states are required.
- Quality: failure modes need evidence and recovery.
- Operations: support-safe errors should include context such as retry and request ID where applicable.
- Security: destructive and permission states should not hide risk.

## Solution

Use the smallest feedback surface that fits the consequence.

```text
inline alert -> state tied to a form, panel, or workflow step
banner -> page-wide condition, outage, permission, or degraded mode
toast -> transient confirmation for non-blocking success or background status
modal/dialog -> user decision, irreversible action, or focused form task
full-page error -> route-level 403, 404, 500, or unavailable state
```

Color is semantic only: blue for information/action, teal for success, amber for warning, red for destructive/error, and neutral for passive status. Feedback should include text, iconography, and placement so meaning does not depend on color alone.

Use `examples/ui/design-reference-kit/ui_kits/account/` and `examples/ui/design-reference-kit/ui_kits/patterns/` as reference implementations.

## Example Structure

```text
Event:
Feedback surface:
Severity:
Message:
Primary action:
Secondary action:
Dismiss behavior:
Recovery path:
Support context:
```

## Tradeoffs

Persistent feedback can add visual weight. Transient feedback is calmer, but it is not suitable for errors, permission failures, destructive confirmations, or anything users may need to reference later.

## Common Mistakes

- Using a toast for a blocking error.
- Showing success with color only and no confirmation copy.
- Omitting retry, request ID, or support context for recoverable failures.
- Using teal, amber, or red to create visual variety instead of semantic feedback.
