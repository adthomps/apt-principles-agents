# APT Project Profile Example

## Context

APT projects need a consistent way to describe what they are, which principles they demonstrate, how mature they are, and whether they should appear in the public Applied Practical Thinking portfolio.

## Problem

Without a profile standard, real projects and conceptual demos can blur together. That makes public storytelling weaker and makes it harder for future projects to reuse working patterns from `apt-coach`, `apt-dream-to-reality`, `apt-novel-reviewer`, `apt-payment-rpc-api`, `crt-world`, and future APT projects.

## APT Principles Applied

- Thinking: clarify the audience, purpose, and success criteria.
- Design: present the project honestly and consistently.
- Architecture: name the system shape and boundaries.
- Knowledge System: capture reusable learning.
- AI & Agent Framework: identify where AI is used and bounded.
- Release & Change Management: describe maturity without overstating readiness.

## Solution

Create a project profile for each APT project using the same fields. The profile can live in `docs/apt/project-profile.md`, be represented as JSON matching `references/project-profile.schema.json`, and feed the public portfolio view in `applied-practical-thinking`.

## Example Structure

```yaml
project: apt-coach
purpose: A coaching and guidance product that applies APT thinking to user goals.
audience:
  - builders
  - learners
  - project owners
adoption_mode: showcase
principles_demonstrated:
  - thinking
  - ai-agent-framework
  - knowledge-system
architecture_pattern: web app plus AI-assisted guidance layer
ai_agent_usage: bounded coaching prompts with source-aware responses
security_model: authenticated user sessions for private coaching state
learning_value: demonstrates how APT doctrine becomes an interactive product
reusable_artifacts:
  - coaching prompt contracts
  - onboarding flow patterns
  - validation reports
maturity: active
showcase:
  include: true
  summary: A real APT product example showing guided thinking, AI assistance, and reusable learning loops.
```

The same structure can describe `apt-dream-to-reality`, `apt-novel-reviewer`, `apt-payment-rpc-api`, `crt-world`, and future APT projects with project-specific evidence.

## APT Coach Adoption Example

APT Coach should use Apply mode when it references this package as external doctrine and keeps local evidence in `docs/apt/`.

Minimum local artifacts:

- `docs/apt/adoption.md` for active principle coverage, validation commands, and exceptions.
- `docs/apt/project-profile.md` for audience, maturity, showcase readiness, and principles demonstrated.
- `docs/apt/runbook-security.md` for app-specific trust boundaries, integrations, secrets, AI fallback behavior, and deferred risks.

Profile language should describe APT Coach as a structured coaching system that uses logged training and approved health context. It should not describe the product as medical, diagnostic, or as having hidden access to data outside validated app inputs.

## Tradeoffs

A shared profile structure creates some upfront documentation work, but it prevents the portfolio site from relying on inconsistent marketing copy. Projects can still add richer case studies when needed.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating an idea as an active project without maturity evidence.
- Omitting security, AI, or architecture notes because they are uncomfortable.
- Copying a project profile into public content without checking current status.
- Rewriting APT doctrine inside a project profile instead of linking to canonical docs.
