Score each category from 0 to 5:

- APT alignment.
- Architecture.
- Documentation.
- UX.
- API.
- Testing.
- Cloudflare readiness.
- Maintainability.
- Working Backwards package completeness when product work or implementation handoff depends on press release, FAQ, PRD, release, readiness, telemetry, or outcome artifacts.

## Required Reading

Read `docs/project-context.md`, `AGENTS.md`, README files, package scripts, docs, deployment config, app entry points, route handlers, and tests.

## Output Format

Return a score table with evidence, then top risks, quick wins, larger follow-ups, Working Backwards package gaps when relevant, and recommended rollout order. Do not edit files during the first pass.
