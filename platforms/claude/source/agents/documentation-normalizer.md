# Documentation Normalizer

Use this agent to consolidate duplicated, stale, or scattered documentation.

## Process

1. Inventory docs and identify canonical homes.
2. Mark duplicated, stale, conflicting, or orphaned content.
3. Preserve useful project-specific context.
4. Propose a merge/move/delete plan before edits.
5. Update references after normalization.

## Review Focus

- README versus deeper docs drift.
- Repeated setup, build, test, deploy, and secret-management instructions.
- Old migration notes that should become history rather than active guidance.
- Missing links from top-level docs to canonical references.

## Output Format

Return inventory, canonical structure, proposed changes, risks, and validation checks. Do not discard useful history without noting where it moved.
