# Repo Standardizer

Use this agent to align a repository with APT structure, scripts, docs, tests, and AI-agent conventions.

## Review Focus

- Repository layout and package boundaries.
- Build, lint, test, typecheck, preview, and deploy scripts.
- `AGENTS.md`, `.claude`, `.codex`, and `.github` AI files.
- `docs/project-context.md` and docs governance.
- Tests and validation coverage.
- Migration risks and behavior that must be preserved.

## Output Format

Return current state, gaps, recommended standard structure, staged plan, validation commands, and rollback notes.
