# APT Service Readiness Review

## Purpose

The Service Readiness Review is a structured pre-launch gate that confirms a service meets APT production standards before it goes live. It is not a rubber stamp — it is a structured checklist requiring evidence.

## When to Conduct

- Before the first production release of any new service.
- Before re-enabling a previously disabled production service.
- Before any major version release that changes external API contracts, auth model, or data schema.

## Participants

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Service owner | Prepares evidence, completes checklist |
| APT reviewer | Reviews evidence, confirms pass/fail |
| Security reviewer | Reviews auth, input handling, secrets |
