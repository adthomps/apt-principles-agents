# {{TITLE}}

## Overview

Summarize the principle area and the kind of work it governs. Explain the question this document answers inside the APT lifecycle.

## Purpose

State why this principle exists, what risk it reduces, and what behavior it should make repeatable across projects.

## Core Principles

Use numbered principles with short names and practical explanations. Each principle should be durable enough to apply across projects, not tied to one implementation.

## When to Use

List the situations where this principle should guide thinking, design, architecture, implementation, review, or release.

## When NOT to Use

Name cases where another APT principle owns the decision or where this document should defer to a more specific standard.

## Standards / Rules

Write enforceable rules. Prefer "must", "should", and "must not" only when the strength is intentional.

Rules should identify required artifacts, ownership, boundaries, validation, and failure conditions where relevant.

## Required Artifacts

List the concrete outputs expected when this principle applies, such as specs, state maps, contracts, review notes, runbooks, prompts, schemas, or decision records.

## Good Example

Provide a short example that shows the principle applied with enough context to recognize the pattern.

## Bad Example

Provide a failure case that explains what goes wrong when the principle is ignored.

## Tradeoffs

Name the cost of applying the principle and the situations where teams may need a documented exception.

## Implementation Notes

Include practical guidance for adopting the principle in a project without duplicating the canonical doctrine.

## AI Prompt Example

Provide a reusable prompt starter for applying or reviewing this principle. Keep durable prompts in `../prompts/`.

## Related Checklists
