# Working Backwards Templates

Use these templates when turning an idea into a staged product package before backlog generation or implementation handoff.

## Package Order

1. Press release
2. External FAQ
3. Internal FAQ
4. Requirements
5. Engineering prompt or implementation blueprint

Each stage should preserve open items with an owner. Blockers must remain visible until resolved and should prevent build handoff.

## Templates

- [Session](session.json)
- [Press Release](press-release.md)
- [FAQ](faq.md)
- [Requirements](requirements.md)
- [Critic Rubric](critic-rubric.json)
- [AI Task Contract](ai-task-contract.json)

## Use In Target Repos

Target repos can copy these templates into their local planning area, `.apt/` package, or product workspace. Claude Code-specific commands, slash commands, and session mechanics belong in platform adapters or internal planning repos; these templates are provider-neutral.
