# ARCHITECTURE.md

## Purpose

This document defines the architectural standards used across APT projects.

---

# Architecture Principles

## Outcome Driven

Architecture exists to support business and user outcomes.

Avoid architecture for architecture's sake.

---

## Practicality

Prefer:

* Simplicity
* Reliability
* Maintainability

Over:

* Novelty
* Complexity
* Over-engineering

---

## Serviceability

Systems should be easy to:

* Support
* Monitor
* Troubleshoot
* Extend

---

# Frontend Standards

Preferred stack:

* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* Tailwind

Guidelines:

* Component driven
* Reusable patterns
* Strong typing
* Minimal state complexity

---

# API Standards

API-first development.

Requirements:

* OpenAPI support
* Consistent error responses
* Pagination
* Validation
* Versioning strategy

Preferred route structure:

```text
/api/v1/*
```

---

# Data Standards

Requirements:

* Stable identifiers
* Audit timestamps
* Referential integrity
* Migration support

Avoid destructive schema changes.

---

# Security Architecture

Principles:

* Least privilege
* Defense in depth
* Secure by default

Requirements:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Audit logging
* Input validation
* Output sanitization

---

# Observability

Required:

* Structured logging
* Request IDs
* Error tracking
* Metrics

Preferred metrics:

* Availability
* Performance
* Errors
* Adoption
* Business outcomes

---

# Documentation Architecture

```text
docs/
├── decisions/
├── diagrams/
├── presentations/
└── reference/
```

---

# Architecture Decision Records

Store in:

```text
docs/decisions/
```

Naming:

```text
ADR-001-title.md
ADR-002-title.md
```

Structure:

* Context
* Decision
* Alternatives
* Consequences

---

# Operational Readiness

Before release:

✓ Monitoring configured

✓ Logging configured

✓ Alerts defined

✓ Documentation updated

✓ Runbooks available

✓ Rollback identified

✓ Support informed

---

# Continuous Improvement

Systems should generate measurable feedback.

Review:

* Performance
* Reliability
* Usage
* Support requests
* User feedback

Use findings to guide future improvements.

---

# APT Architecture Definition of Done

✓ Architecture documented

✓ Security reviewed

✓ Data model reviewed

✓ APIs documented

✓ Monitoring defined

✓ Operational impact reviewed

✓ Support readiness confirmed

✓ Future maintainers can understand the system

# Downstream Project Repository Template

Use this layout when starting a new project that adopts APT. Product and application repos should follow this structure — it differs intentionally from `apt-principles-agents` itself, which is a doctrine repo, not a product repo.

## Key differences from `apt-principles-agents`

| `apt-principles-agents` (doctrine repo) | Downstream project repo |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Canonical principle files at root | Principle files live in `docs/` |
| `checklists/`, `prompts/`, `references/` as first-class dirs | Checklists and prompts copied/adapted into `.github/` |
| Agents scope to doctrine maintenance | Agents scope to product implementation roles |
| No `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Add only if monorepo |
| Scripts: validate doctrine structure | Scripts: validate project health and docs |

## Adoption modes

See [checklists/project-adoption-checklist.md](../checklists/project-adoption-checklist.md) for gate criteria per mode.

- **Copy**: vendor selected APT assets into the project at project setup; update manually on APT version bumps.
- **Sync**: periodically refresh `.github/agents/`, `.github/prompts/`, and skills from `apt-principles-agents`.
- **Apply**: reference `apt-principles-agents` as external canonical source; keep local docs linked but not copied.
- **Showcase**: publish a `docs/apt/adoption.md` with maturity evidence for public portfolio.
