# Thinking

**Principle:** Frame the problem before proposing a solution.

Thinking turns ambiguous ideas into explicit decisions, constraints, and measurable success criteria.

## Core Rules

- Do not write code before the problem statement is clear.
- Record decisions that affect scope, architecture, security, or release.
- Document tradeoffs — what is gained, what is lost, and why the tradeoff is acceptable.
- Acknowledge constraints (budget, time, platform, compliance) as design inputs.
- If the problem is unclear, produce a framing brief before producing code.

## Required Artifacts

- Problem statement
- Audience definition
- Success criteria
- Constraint map
- Tradeoff notes
- Decision log entry for durable choices

## Enforcement Points

- No implementation plan without a clear problem statement.
- A requested feature is not automatically the root problem.
- Assumptions that affect scope or security must be recorded.
