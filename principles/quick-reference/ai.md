# AI & Agents

**Principle:** AI accelerates structured work without bypassing APT doctrine, security, or validation gates.

AI follows the system — it does not invent architecture, standards, or patterns outside defined rules.

## Core Rules

- Agents must use canonical docs and existing patterns, not invent new standards.
- Prompts must specify layer (thinking, design, architecture, build, validation, release, support, documentation).
- Good agent work requires explicit context: sources, constraints, expected artifacts, and output format.
- Agents may suggest alternatives; implementation must respect boundaries and review gates.
- Human approval is required for destructive actions, secrets access, production deploys, and security-sensitive changes.

## Agent Contract (required for durable prompts)

Every agent prompt must define:

- Role
- Task
- Canonical sources to read
- In-scope work
- Out-of-scope work
- Expected output format
- Validation requirements
- Escalation conditions

## Enforcement Points

- Agents must not bypass authentication, authorization, or validation gates.
- AI-generated code follows the same review process as human code.
- Prompts governing repeated work belong in `prompts/`.
- Agents must report assumptions, changed files, validation outcome, and residual risk.
