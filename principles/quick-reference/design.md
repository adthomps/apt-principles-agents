# Design

**Principle:** Define complete behavior before implementation spreads design decisions across code.

Design answers what the solution communicates, how it behaves across every state, and what the user experiences.

## Core Rules

- Design complete behavior: cover loading, empty, success, error, and permission-denied states.
- Clarity over cleverness — interfaces must communicate without guessing.
- Systems over screens — design the pattern, not just the screen.
- Consistency beats novelty — prefer established patterns over one-off interactions.
- Accessibility is required, not optional (WCAG 2.2 AA minimum).

## Design Hierarchy

1. User Goals
2. Accessibility
3. Usability
4. Consistency
5. Visual Design

Visual styling must never override usability.

## Required Artifacts

- DESIGN.md in the project
- State coverage (all states handled)
- Acceptance criteria per user flow
- Tradeoff notes for non-standard patterns

## Enforcement Points

- Missing state coverage (empty, error, loading) is a blocker.
- Accessibility failures are blockers.
- New visual patterns require explicit rationale.
